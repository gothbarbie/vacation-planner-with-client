# Vacation Planner - With Client

What is this project? Well, its partly a practical tool for people to plan their vacation at a shared location (like a summer house or similar). 

Its also an opportunity for me to show my skills in backend as well as frontend. The project is likely to be updated and changed in the future with new technology as I learn it and need a private project to hone my skills.
